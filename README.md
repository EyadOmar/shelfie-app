# Shelfie — A React Native Books App

## Overview

This project is built while following the **Complete React Native Course** on YouTube by freeCodeCamp.  
The playlist walks through building a React Native app—from setting up with Expo, working with core components like Text, View & Image, to building navigation-heavy, stateful functionality.
